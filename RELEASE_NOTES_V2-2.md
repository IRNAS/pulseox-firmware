# DEBUG RELEASE NOTES (V2-2)

## Fixes
- MCU STM32F030F4P6 replaced with STM32F070F6P6 (having more ROM and RAM allowing to implement more desired features)
- V2-1 firmware adapted for the new MCU
- display orientation adapted to V2-2 hardware

## Improvements
- Brightness adjustment algorithm added
- User interface features added

## User Action
- Read the updated section V2-2 in [this repository](https://github.com/IRNAS/pulseox-testing/tree/master/firmware_test_debug/V2-2).
- Brightness adjustment parameters still need to be optimized. Glia team is instructed to follow the procedure described [in this issue](https://github.com/IRNAS/pulseox-testing/issues/2). Upon completion IRNAS team will release the complete V2-2 firmware.
